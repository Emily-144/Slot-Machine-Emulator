# Slot-Machine-Emulator &#127920;
### One of the major projects that I worked on in Fall of 2022 and the one I am probably most proud of!  

**Assignment:**  
Create a GUI Java application that simulates a slot machine.

This program is meant to simulate a slot machine, where the user inputs money, spins the slots, and collects winnings. The user can choose bet amount and denomination. The program displays many of its errors in the form of alerts to avoid crashing. I may revisit this project in the future to make the individual slots appear as if they are spinning.

**Languages/Resources Used:**  
1. Java
2. Eclipse IDE
3. [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/) for sound effects

*Images for the slots provided by the instructor*
